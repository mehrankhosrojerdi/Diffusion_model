`What is Sampeling?`
![](docs/images/Sampling_first_part.png)

Sampling is the neural network after it's trained at inference time.
So what happens is you have that noise sample. 
You put it through your trained neural network 
that has understood what a sprite kind of 
looks like and what it does is it predicts noise. It predicts noise 
as opposed to the sprite and then we subtract 
that predicted noise from the noise sample to get something a little 
bit more sprite-like.
